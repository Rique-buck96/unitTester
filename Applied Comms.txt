When the source node transmits the data, it performs an algorithm called a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). CRC takes the values of all the preceding fields in the frame and generates a unique 4-byte number, the FCS. When the destination node receives the frame, its data link services unscramble the FCS via the same CRC algorithm and ensure that the frame's fields match their original form. If the comparison fails, the receiving node assumes that the frame has been damaged in transit and requests that the source node retransmit the data.",
