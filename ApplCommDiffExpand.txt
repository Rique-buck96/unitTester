Describe how error checking is handled in the data link layer. 

Error checking is accomplished by a 4-byte frame check sequence field.
	(4-byte field does the job)

Whose purpose is to ensure that the data at teh destination exactly match 
the data issued from the source.
	(FCS purpose)

When the source node transmits the data, it performs an algorithm called a 
cycic redundancy check.
	(source transmits)

CRC takes the values of all the preceding fields in the frame and generates a 
unique 4-byte number, the FCS.
	(What CRC does)

When the destination node receives the frame, its data link services unscramble 
the FCS via the same CRC algorithm and ensure that the frame's fields match their 
original form. 
	(when dest gets frame)

If the comparrison fails, the receiving node assumes that the frame has been damaged 
in transit and requests that the source node retransmit the data. 
	(if it fails)

Describe FHSS and DSSS spread spectrum technology. (frequencies) 

FHSS transmission: signal jumps between several different freq within a band in a syns pattern 
					known only to the channel's receiver and transmitter.
			
DSSS transmission: A signal's bits are distributed over entire frequency band at once.

Explain how the traceroute utitlity uses ICMP ECHO requests to trace the path from 
	one networked node to another. 
	
It transmits a series of UDP datagrams to a specified destination. 
using either the IP address or the host name to identify the destination.

What is the purpose of the frame control field in an 802.11 frame?

Holds info about protocol in use.
Type of frame being transmitted.
Whether thee frame is part of a larger, fragmented packet. 
Whether the frame is one that was reissued after an unverified delivery attempt. 
Type of security frame uses.

Describe what distinguishes 802.1x from other authentication standards. 

Applies to communication with a particular port. 

When a client wants to access the network, a port on the authenticator challenges the client 
to prove its identity. 

If the client is running the proper 802.1x software, the client will supply the 
authenticator with its credentials.

Describe L2TP technology

Based on tech developed by Cisco and standardized by IETF.

Encapsulates PPP data in a similar manner to PPTP but unlike PPTP, 
is a standard accepted and used by multiple different vendors. 

So it can connect a VPN that uses a mix of equipment types. 


////////////////

Within an ethernet frame, describe the FCS field and explain how it is used to make the header. 

ensures data received by the destination node 
exactly match the data sent by the source node 
using the CRC algorithm.
